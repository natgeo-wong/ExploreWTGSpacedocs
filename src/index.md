Implementations of the Weak Temperature Gradient (WTG) approximation have been used for nearly twenty years as a popular method to couple convection and to large-scale atmospheric dynamics within the tropics.  In this project, we investigate how the different implementations interact with the model parameter space, including:
* Horizontal domain size and resolution
* Sea-surface temperature
* Vertical domain resolution
* Interactive and non-interactive radiation

There are many different results that we will touch on in this project website, but the most important set of results that we will go through will be why, even in experiments with idealized model setups, there are differences in the model response to different implementations of the WTG.
